[00:40.66] The cycle repeated
[00:46.57] As explosions broke in the sky
[00:50.22] All that I needed
[00:55.16] Was the one thing I couldn't find
[00:58.97] And you were there at the turn
[01:02.40] Waiting to let me know
[01:07.96] We're building it up
[01:11.88] To break it back down
[01:16.27] We're building it up
[01:20.91] To burn it down
[01:22.39] We can't wait
[01:24.21] To burn it to the ground
[01:33.90] The colors conflicted
[01:38.81] As the flames, climbed into the clouds
[01:42.51] I wanted to fix this
[01:47.14] But couldn't stop from tearing it down
[01:50.97] And you were there at the turn
[01:54.58] Caught in the burning glow
[02:00.00] And I was there at the turn
[02:03.07] Waiting to let you know
[02:08.56] We're building it up
[02:13.00] To break it back down
[02:17.27] We're building it up
[02:21.94] To burn it down
[02:23.42] We can't wait
[02:24.92] To burn it to the ground
[02:26.94] You told me yes
[02:28.24] You held me high
[02:29.34] And I believed when you told that lie
[02:31.53] I played soldier, you played king
[02:33.72] And struck me down, when I kissed that ring
[02:35.80] You lost that right, to hold that crown
[02:37.98] I built you up, but you let me down
[02:40.16] So when you fall, I'll take my turn
[02:42.26] And fan the flames
[02:43.59] As your blazes burn
[02:44.63] And you were there at the turn
[02:46.71] Waiting to let me know
[02:52.59] We're building it up
[02:56.88] To break it back down
[03:00.99] We're building it up
[03:05.38] To burn it down
[03:06.78] We can't wait
[03:08.49] To burn it to the ground
[03:11.30] When you fall, I'll take my turn
[03:12.84] And fan the flames
[03:13.90] As your blazes burn
[03:15.14] We can't wait
[03:17.59] To burn it to the ground
[03:19.76] When you fall, I'll take my turn
[03:21.54] And fan the flames
[03:22.97] As your blazes burn
[03:24.11] We can't wait
[03:26.38] To burn it to the ground
